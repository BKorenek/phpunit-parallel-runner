## Story
**As a**  [ user ],
**I want** [ to use the search field to type a city, name, or street ]
**so that** [ I could find matching hotel options]

## Acceptance Criteria
*Hint: These are rules based on the behavior of the system's functionality and the target audience for acceptance criteria doesn’t need precise details of the test scenarios.*

* The search field is placed on the top bar

* Search starts once the user clicks “Search”

* The field contains a placeholder with a grey-colored text: “Where are you going?”

* The placeholder disappears once the user starts typing

* Search is performed if a user types in a city, hotel name, street, or all combined

* Search is in English, French, German, and Ukrainian

* The user can’t type more than 200 symbols

* The search doesn’t support special symbols (characters). If the user has typed a special symbol, show the warning message: “Search input cannot contain  special symbols.”
